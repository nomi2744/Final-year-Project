We need to inspect the source page and copy page url by going into network tab also copy its cookies value by going into network tab---------> storage tab, and paste in command in phpssied tab. Command is [ hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/john.lst 'http-get-form://127.0.0.1:42001/vulnerabilities/brute/:username=^USER
^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login:H=Cookie\:PHPSESSID=t8nko80b5lf4caqlpeurp0nu9f; security=low:F=Username and/or password incorrect']

d. Room-Brute it (THM). In this room  - Brute-force, Hash cracking, Privilege escalation
(1) Search machine. Open ports and services running.
(2) Now search for hidden directories. Use command
(a) ffuf -u http://10.10.65.239/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists /dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
(b) ffuf -u http://10.10.65.239/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists /Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
(c) we found admin Dir.

(d)  Now browse it, and inspect by [ctrl+U]. adminn username is found. 

(3) To get reverse shell.	Now we need to brute force the password. Using hydra. Command is [ hydra -l -P /usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt 10.10..0 "/admin/:user=^USER^&pass=^PASS^:F=username or password invalid" -V -I -t 4]      -I is to ignore any error.

(4) Here we have found the key and can be cracked with John, copy the key in new file. 
(5) Now convert the  key into john acceptable format. And get the phrase for key.
Copy file content in another file and make it executable by changing mode. 
(6) Use ssh to connect ot machine. And get user.txt [ssh john@10.10.. -I key.pm]

(7) Now for privileges escalation, cat out password and shadow files content into new files. And to save hash in a new file, unshadow both files into a newe file. 
(8) Use john to crack it.  We get the root password.
e. File upload vulnerability in Web Application: this vuln allows attacker to upload files to the server.
(1) Low security
(a) Create msfvenom payload (provide IP address and LPORt)
(b) Run Metasploit and start a multi handler to listen  to php reverse session.
(2) Medium security
(a) File has to be type jpeg.
(b) Start burpsuite and capture the traffic.
(c) Change file type to Image/jpeg and fwd the request.
(d) Now, file be uploaded and by this way we can get metepreter.	
(3) high security.		
(a) Have to add GIF89a; at the start of file. Otherwise file will not be uploaded on server. After accessing we don’t get any shell.
(b) Goto dvwa, rename the uploaded file into exploit.php.jpeg and upload it.
(c) Here we have to got to command injection and rename the uploaded file to exploit.php, then we will get the meterpreter shell.
(d) Now try to open the file, now we have got the shell. By this we can chain multiple vuln to exploit our tgt.
f. SQL injection attk. Can also be used to create other user with high privileges. SQL injection is a type of attack in which an attacker injects malicious code into a website’s SQL statement and gains access to sensitive information or performs malicious actions on the database. can allow attackers to bypass authentication, access, modify, or delete sensitive data, or even execute commands on the operating system.
(1) Login with any credentials with * at user end, if no error msg than it means it is not vuln to normal sql injection attk.
(2) For blind injection: Login with at end of user*or1=1--. If login means site is vuln to sql attks.
(3) To add new user in db. Login with this querry : blah:iner into login values (‘name’,’password’);--  by this new user will be addes into db.
(4) We can also create new db with querry. 	Blah;create my data base;--    .tthis will be dropped by using drop command. 
(5) We can also run some processes : we can create a process with ping functionality. 
(6) Perform sql injection attk against MSSQL to extract db using sqlmap. We will loginan a registered user and try to extract password of other users. 
(a) Login and view profile. Note the url once page load. 
(b) Inspect  the page and in console tab write document.cookie, copy the cookie value. 
(c) Now in terminal window type [sqlmap -u {url of profile } –cookies =”copied value of cookiey”  --dbs ] 
(d) When databases are found, now we will eneumerate tables.
(e) To gain shell: we will write same command except at place of –dbs we will write [–os-shell]
(7) Detect sql injection vuln using DSSS(Damn Small Sqli Scanner). Process same as above and write command as shown in figure:

By this we can scan a website and identify sql injection vulns and find the vuln url. 
(8)  Detect sql injection vuln using OWASP ZAP (OWASP Zed attk proxy) .
Open OWASP  and start attk.  We can scan a website for vuln.
g. SQLmap-THM room
(1) [Sqlmap --url http://testphp.vulnweb.com/ --crawl 2  --threads 3 –batch]
(a) 
(2) Scan the IP, open port is found

(3) Access the site and try to find aval directories. Using [Gobuster dir-----/rockyou.txt]. blood is found.

(4) Moving on to the hidden directory, we find a webapp with the ability to login and register. 
(5) use Burpsuite to intercept the login page and save it to a TXT file.

(6) now use SQLMap to enumarate the Databases for Usernames, Passwords and all data that can be found in it . 
(7) we know the name of the Database we look for tables available in the DB, using  cmd [sqlmap -r req.txt -D blood –tables].

(8) Now that we are interested in the flag table. We run the dump command to find its details using cmd [sqlmap -r req.txt -D blood -T flag –dump]

(9) To find current user: [sqlmap -r req.txt –batch –threads 3 –current-user]
(10) 
h. Hacking Wordpress Websites with WPscan.	Can be used to enumerate user, theme,plugins. 
(1) Once we have user name we an brute force their password. Using cmd when username is known [wpscan --url http://wpscan.thm/ --usernames Phreakazoid --passwords /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt]
(a) We can also try yo find username by gusing an seeing the input fd.

(2) When both username and password are not known:-
(a) 192.168.10.0/wp-admin/   this will allow login.
(b) Now we will use this cmd [wpscan -u 192.168… -e u vp]. -e to enumerate, u is to enumerate usernames. Vp is to tgt vuln plugins. This will give us default username. / [wpscan -u 192.1-- -e u /wordlist]. By wordlist mentioned we can find username and password also.
(c) Now to bruteforce passwords, as we know the username use cmd [

Module- Android Hacking 
1. Exploit android through Adb (Android Debug Bridge)Using phonesploit:-	phonesploit is a framework with which we can exploit android devices , it uses ADB port 5555 to connect to a device and run commands on it.  For this android should have developer mode on.  Android to be in developer mode and usb debugging should be on.
a. By this we can download pics from downloads or take as creen shot
b. 
c. If folder is not found. Use cmd [find -type d -name “scans”]
2. Adb easy way: Connect to Android through ADB and access files via shell
a. Scan network range and find which is android device. [netdiscover -r 192.1…./24]. Run [nmap _o 192….] To find OS of that device. Either we have found correct one or not.
b. Install adb
(1) Apt-get update
(2) Apt-get install adb -y
(3) 
c. Now list devices connected. [adb devices -l]
d. Now connect device. [connect adb 192.1279.0.0:555]

e. How to get shell access: 
(1) Adb shell
(2) Now we will goto sd card and look for file, here we have created a file.
(3) 
f. Now to download file
(1) Adb pull source destination
(2) 
g. To take screen shot and save it in sd card. [Adb shell screencap -p /sdcard/screencap.png]
h. Noe to push files: []adb push ./mydocs.txt /sdcard/
